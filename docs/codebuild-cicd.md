# Codebuild CI/CD Pipeline

The goal of the Codebuild CI/CD pipeline is to provide a scaffold for Senzing developers to easily automate pesky devops tasks such as testing and deployment.

## Overview

Currently, the pipeline seeks to automate 2 task
1. Test any changes in the source code to smoke out breaking changes before it is integrated into the main branch.
1. Build code that is merged into the main branch and deploy to it's respective container registry

The following is a flow diagram of the automation done with github action and codebuild.
