# Codebuild CI/CD Pipeline

The goal of the Codebuild CI/CD pipeline is provide a scaffold for Senzing developers to easily automate pesky devops tasks such as testing and deployment.

## Overview

Currently, the pipeline seeks to automate 2 task
- test code change to smoke out any breaking changes
- deploy code that is pushed to the main branch to the specified container registry

Additional instructions can also be found here on how this pipeline can be extended.

The following is a flow diagram of the automation done with github action and codebuild.
